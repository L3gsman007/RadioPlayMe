ðŸ“» Internet Radio Player â€“ README (plain-English).


The program is a self-contained Flask web app that lets users:

    Listen to on-line internet radio streams (Shoutcast / Icecast or any MP3/Ogg or AAC URL)
    Search by name, genre or country
    Save personal favourites and keep a "recently played" history

I have provided a permanent demo stream (https://cvtfradio.net:8090, its my own radio station) is always available for first-time visitors.

Quick start to run the code:

    Install Python 3.11 or newer.
    Download / unzip the folder.
    Inside the folder open a terminal and type:

pip install -r requirements.txt (or even uv sync, if you have it setup).
python run.py

    Open your browser at for example http://localhost:7860
    Run the script it opens up in the browser, the demo radio station loads (should do this automatically) and the Search panel is open.
    This allows the user to either play the demo or start a new search for their own radio stations.
