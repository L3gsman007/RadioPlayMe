ðŸ“» Internet Radio Player â€“ README (plain-English).


Limitations on scripts as it stands:

Warning the script is still at an Alpha test stage, so it's a bit buggy (functionality wise).
Sometimes it loads without a search dialogue. I found that once there at least 1 radio station in the Favourites, users can play that demo radio station, then the Search funtions normally.
The app needs a bit of sorting out, I still learning so any help would be very helpful.

The program is a self-contained Flask web app that lets users:

    Listen to on-line internet radio streams (Shoutcast / Icecast or any MP3/Ogg or AAC URL)
    Search by name, genre or country
    Save personal favourites and keep a "recently played" history

I have provided a permanent demo stream (https://cvtfradio.net:8090 , my own radio station) is always available for first-time visitors and should not be deleted!.
If the default demo radio station is deleted from Favourites, the icons (buttons) do not function anymore, especially the Search icon -You have been warned.

Quick start to run the code:

    Install Python 3.11 or newer.
    Download / unzip the folder.
    Inside the folder open a terminal and type:

pip install -r requirements.txt (or even uv sync, if you have it setup).
python run.py

    Open your browser at for example http://localhost:9000
    Run the script opens up in the browser, the demo radio station loads (should do this automatically) and the Search panel is open.
    This allows the user to either play the demo or start a new search.

    
Folder map (what each file does)

run.py-starts the local web-server
app.py-creates the Flask app and the database
routes.py-all web pages and JSON APIs
models.py-database tables (favourites, history)
radio_service.py-talks to radio-browser.info to find stations
requirements.txt-list of Python libraries to install
templates/index.htm-the web page you see in the browser
static/js/radio_player.js-play / pause / volume / search buttons
static/css/custom.css-colours & layout (optional)
radio_player.db-your local SQLite database (created automatically)

For developers

    Language: Python 3.11+ (Flask) + HTML5 + Bootstrap 5 + vanilla JavaScript
    Database: SQLite (no server needed) â€“ file is created on first run
    External API: radio-browser.info (free, no key required)
    Default port: 9000 (change in run.py if you need another)
    Environment variables (all optional):
        PORT â€“ server port (default 9000)
        DATABASE_URL â€“ full SQLite path or Postgres URI
        SESSION_SECRET â€“ Flask session cookie secret

How the default station should work:

    On first start the app writes the demo row into radio_player.db and flags it as a favourite.
    The back-end should not allow delete that row â€“ new users can remove their own stations, but the demo should stay.
    The front-end automatically starts that stream when the page opens (so new visitors hear something immediately).
